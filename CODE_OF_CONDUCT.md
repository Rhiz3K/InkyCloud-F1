# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity
and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the
  experience
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their
  explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They will take
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is
officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported via
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/Rhiz3K/InkyCloud-F1/security/advisories/new).
All complaints will be reviewed promptly and fairly. The project team will respect the privacy
and security of the reporter and any witnesses.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines when determining the consequences
for any action they deem to be in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or
unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the
nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology
may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people
involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a
specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in project spaces as well as external
channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate
behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any form of interaction or public communication with the
community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved,
including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this
period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement
of classes of individuals.
